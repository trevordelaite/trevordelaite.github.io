  <p>I spent last summer playing baseball in Bellingham, Washington for the Bellingham Bells. It was the best summer of my life and the best baseball experience I have ever had. 
  My host family was awesome and they took us to a bunch of places. They also took us to a Seattle Mariners baseball game and took us crabbing. Our baseball team was very good and easily the best team I have played on.</p>
